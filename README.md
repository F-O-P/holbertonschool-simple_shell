## Overview

The Simple Shell Project is a basic Unix shell implementation that reads user commands and executes them. It supports running both built-in commands and external programs.

## Installation

To install the Holberton Shell Project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/F-O-P/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git
    Compile the program by running:
    
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
   
    Run the shell with ./hsh

## Usage

Once you've installed the Holberton Shell Project, you can run it by typing ./hsh in your terminal. The shell will display a prompt ($ ) and wait for you to enter a command.

Here are some example commands you can try:

### Simple Shell
```
    $ ls
    $ pwd
    $ echo "Hello, world!"
```

You can also run built-in commands (see the next section for details).

To exit the shell, type exit or press Ctrl-D.

## Built-In Commands

Our Simple Shell supports the following built-in commands:

    exit: Exit the shell
    env: Print the environment variables
