.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]Simple Shell\f[R] \- a simple UNIX command interpreter in C for
Holberton School
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
simple_shell [OPTIONS] [FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program is a simple shell that runs bash commands entered by the
user from the input stream.
Each command is a sequence of non\-blank words separated by a space,
where the first word specifies the name of the command to be executed
and subsequent words are considered arguments or flags associated with
the command.
.PP
The shell can read input lines interactively from standard output or
non\-interactively from a piped file.
It is designed to behave like a UNIX shell, but it does not support all
bash features and options.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
hsh is the name of the executable that allows the user to enter interactive mode.

file and exit.
.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
The following commands can be called and handled directly in the shell without requiring a child process to be executed. However, if a failure occurs during execution, these commands may return non\-zero exit statuses.

exit:
    Exits the shell. Returns an exit status of 0 on successful execution. If the command invoked cannot execute, it returns an exit status of 126. If the command is not found, it returns an exit status of 127. In case of a failure due to misuse of the shell builtin, it returns an exit status of 2.
    
env:
    Prints the variables from the current environment.
\f[R]
.fi
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
The exit status of hsh indicates the success or failure of the
previously executed command.
If no command is executed, the exit status is 0.
